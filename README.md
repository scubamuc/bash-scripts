I'm **not a developer** and any real developer would probably laugh at my scripts calling me a **novice**. 
While this is absolutely true, my scripts do what I expect them to do.

Notice how almost every line is commented? That's because I like to know what is happening and if I don't write it down I'm bound to forget! 
Its all about doing the basics...

If you find what you need, thats great and you're welcome ðŸ¤¿ ðŸ‘Œ
