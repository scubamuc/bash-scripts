I'm no developer myself and any real developer would laugh at my scripts calling me an amateur. 
While this is absolutely true, I understand what I'm doing and my scripts do what I expect them to do. 

So use the scripts at own risk. Adapt them to your needs if you like.

Notice how almost every line is commented? 
That's because I like to know what is happening and if I don't write it down I'm bound to forget! 
Its all about doing the basics...
